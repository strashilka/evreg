Hi.

My application is available by link https://evreg.netlify.app/
It is build there from my GitHub project https://github.com/strashilka/evreg/ (branch master)

Implemented is all levels but the last task of Advanced level (task by crone). I'll try to do it tomorrow (on my forth
day and push to branch dev).

Storage of Events is local for now, but Participants are stored to Firebase. Filled are only two first (if not use any
sort). When you will try fill data, there is hard validation: "18 years old", to pass it please change you date manualy.

Write me to Telegram, if you will have any questions @strashulka
